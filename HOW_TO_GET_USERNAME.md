# How to Get Your Telegram Username

## Quick Steps

1. Open Telegram
2. Go to **Settings** → **Profile**
3. Your username is shown under your name (starts with `@`)
4. **Copy it exactly as shown** - usernames are **case sensitive**

## Example

If Telegram shows: `@Tsaidani1`  
Use exactly: `Tsaidani1` (not `tsaidani1` or `Tsaidani`)

## Important

- Usernames are **case sensitive** - uppercase and lowercase matter
- Include only the username part (without the `@` symbol)
- Double-check the exact capitalization before submitting
